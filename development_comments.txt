#1 Creating Django Project
A new Django web app project is created by running:

django-admin startproject <web_app_name>

This creates a folder with a manage.py file. Manage.py is used to run the server or create migrations


#2: Building Apps
Django web applications are made up of apps. Each app represents a service.
To create new django apps run:

python manage.py <app name>

This command will generate all the files needed to create a functioning app


#3 Models & Database Configuration

A model is a framework that encapsulate the information of users (email, name and etc)
which will be used to process services in our web application. Models written in Python
must be transformed to be compatible with Databases.

python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>  accomplishes this. This generates a new file related to the model

Running python manage.py migrate sends and configures the database based on the file generated from python manage.py makemigration


# Running application

python manage.py runserver

# PRO TIPS

Use Postman to test POST and GET queries to web app

# SUPER IMPORTANT

Model Modifications means you have to run makemigration again and then migrate.
If migrate pushes "no migrations to apply", then follow this guide to troubleshoot:

# Node.js dependencies

# npm init -y creates Javascript package with dependency list (generates package.json & package-lock.json)
# npm i -D webpack webpack-cli. Install we
# npm i -D @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-plugin-transform-class-properties

# Installing React

#  npm i react react-dom prop-types

# Build .babelrc file in root directory of project

# create webpack.config.js file. Build module.exports

# Modify package.json file. Change values in script key. We'll create a "dev" and
"build" script. "dev" script build a development executable of web app whereas "build"
will build a production ready version of the web application.
